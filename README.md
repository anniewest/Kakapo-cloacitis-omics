# Kakapo-cloacitis-omics
Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses of kākāpō with active exudative cloacitis (with healthy controls) developed for the manuscript 'Elusive aetiology of exudative cloacitis in the critically endangered kākāpō'.

Scripts were primarily developed by Michael Hoggard and run on the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure ([NeSI]([url](https://www.nesi.org.nz/))).
